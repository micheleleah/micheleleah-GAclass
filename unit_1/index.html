    <h1>I Can Do That</h1>
    <h3>Let me take that off your plate.</h3>
    <p>I'll reorganize your Google Drive, reconcile the QuickBooks accounts, draft a killer marketing plan, and design a new logo before lunch. I'm preternaturally skilled at events management and darn good at herding cats.</p>
